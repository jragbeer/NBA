# NBA
All NBA datasets that I play with will go here. Usually from Github or webscraped from ESPN.com using BeautifulSoup.

This repo includes a Bokeh dashboard highlighting player stats throughout their career (and showing how they compared to the NBA average during that time). The dataset for that can be found here : https://www.kaggle.com/drgilermo/nba-players-stats

Additionally, the code for a slideshow that shows some things that I wanted to see from a FT dataset spanning 10 years. The dataset for the slideshow can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/sebastianmantey/nba-free-throws. Here I also add an update dataset to include the seasons from the end of that dataset to present. It is included in this repo as 'nba_free_throws_2017_present.csv'.

Some data was scraped from the web.... 

This includes player salary data, which was taken form Hoop Hype (a number of years were taken): https://hoopshype.com/salaries/players/2017-2018/

As well, team membership data was taken from ESPN, corresponding to each game number from the NBA Free Throws dataset hosted on Kaggle.
An example webpage would be: http://www.espn.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=401071852

An ipython notebook will be created that mirrors the slideshow.
