# NBA
All NBA datasets that I play with will go here. Usually from Github or webscraped from ESPN.com using BeautifulSoup.

This repo includes a Bokeh dashboard highlighting player stats throughout their career (and showing how they compared to the NBA average during that time). The dataset for that can be found here : https://www.kaggle.com/drgilermo/nba-players-stats

Additionally, the code for a slideshow that shows some things that I wanted to see from a FT dataset spanning 10 years. The dataset for the slideshow can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/sebastianmantey/nba-free-throws

An ipython notebook will be created that mirrors the slideshow.
